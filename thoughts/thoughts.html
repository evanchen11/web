        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>As I continue to build this website, I'm constantly thinking about what I want to put in it. I recently realized that I don't have many opportunities
            to exercise my creativity during my day to day life. That's partly why I'm building this site in the first place. The process of designing, building, 
            and refining these pages to my taste is a fun and creative process in and of itself. I'll always be able to modify it to my current tastes. But it's not only that. 
            After my epiphany, I've been viewing this website as a way to encourage myself to pursue in various creative hobbies. I want to use it as a repository to display the projects that I'm proud of.
            I already have so many activities that I want to try out-cooking, retro filming, music, astrophotography, home iot projects. I'll be showing and telling all this stuff.

        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <p>This is a personal project. This isn't supposed to be anything fancy, if anything it's mainly for my own eyes. I'm not entirely sure what I plan on doing with this
            website yet. For the most part, I plan on using it to deposit my thoughts about things I find cool, and things I've been trying. </p>
