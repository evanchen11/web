I'm thinking about writing a blog to place my thoughts.
This blog's purpose can be to encourage me to try new things that are outside of my comfort zone.
Try new recipes, review music and books.
talk about my day.
Things like book reviews, nature photgraphy/videos.
I think i'm gonna keep this website to myself for awhile, until it's fully done.


Maybe in the music tab, I'll put a header paragraph talking about how i'll update this page with the music that I've been enjoying the most recently.
And below that, put a couple songs and their album pictures. With a blurb for each song talking about what it means to me, if anything. or if i simply enjoy it.




I'm using masonry.js to achieve that dynamic masonry layout look. The problem is that this is so damn annoying. 
I have to hardcode the dimensions of each box and test it out to achieve the layout that I want. If I change anything, the whole page gets screwed up and I have to manually adjust everything again. 
There's probably a better way to do this, but I can't be bothered to look. I'm probably going to limit it to < 10 songs and pictures so that I have less to deal with.



TODO:
change homepage slideshow to video
change title to match header/intro
Add a way to cut off long blog entries and add a read more button.
After the text animation finishes in interests, let the media below start fading in 
add a slideshow of interactive calendars, month by month.
